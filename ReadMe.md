# TheoTown Unpacker
Just a casual afternoon project.
<br />

Decrypts *.lby files found in the assets folder of TheoTown's apk, and then dumps out all the lua scripts for the game.

## Usage
**Note for Android users:** Tkinter doesn't work on Android, so use the command-line options. Use the -h flag to see all options.

To use it, run the file with python and it'll do the rest. Enjoy. â˜•
